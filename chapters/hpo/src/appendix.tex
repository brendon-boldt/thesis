\end{table}
One of XferBench's chief weaknesses is its long runtime, taking $2$ to $6$ hours depending on the GPU used.
Approximately $30\%$ of that time is spent on the initial pretraining with the emergent language corpus, with the other $70\%$ spent on finetuning and testing on the $10$ downstream languages.
We observe from the XferBench scores on the emergent languages of ELCC and the human language baselines of \cref{ch:xferbench} that $9$ out of the $10$ evaluation languages are highly correlated with each other, that is, the XferBench score on one language is highly predictive of the overall XferBench score.
In particular, test cross-entropy on Danish (da) alone can predict ${>}95\%$ of the variation of the overall XferBench score (i.e., the linear regression has an $R^2>0.95$).
For this reason, in the hyperparameter optimization trials, we compute XferBench-da (XferBench evaluated on Danish only) which is around $3{\times}$ faster than the full XferBench; the final evaluation nevertheless uses the full set of evaluation language for XferBench.

In \Cref{tab:target-corr}, we show the $R^2$ values derived from training a linear model on just one of the target language's XferBench scores to predict the overall XferBench score.
The emergent languages are all of the corpora from ELCC (\cref{ch:elcc}), and the human language corpora are the baselines from the original XferBench paper (\cref{ch:xferbench}).
$R^2$ value corresponds to the percent of the variance in the full XferBench score explained by just the score (i.e., cross-entropy) on that particular target language.
We find, strikingly enough, that all of the target languages, with the exception of Basque, are highly correlated, having $R^2$ values above $0.95$ all languages, and greater than $0.80$ even when considering human languages alone.
Danish, of all of the languages, has the highest $R^2$ value (${>}0.99$), which is the reason we select it as the sole target for a more time-efficient variant of XferBench (which we term XferBench-da).


\section{Hyperparameters Not Discussed}
\unskip\label{hpo:sec:not-discussed}
In this section we briefly discuss hyperparameters that were tried but not not documented in the paper or that were not investigated at all.
We selected a batch size of $32$ based on comparing the compute efficiency of different sizes.
Larger batch sizes could process more data faster but would not update the parameters often enough.
On the other hand, smaller batch sizes would not process enough data to maximize the utility of each update.
Mixed precision training was tested but not found to improve runtime.
% distribution: SearchCat = "cat", ("Uniform",)
For learning rate scheduling, we found cosine annealing to be slightly more effective than no learning, but further schedules were not investigated.
Weight decay was investigated in earlier experiment but found not to have a noticeable effect.

The implementation of the signaling game we used could also be optimized using REINFORCE to handle the discrete message, but we only tested with a Gumbel-Softmax layer as it is faster and more stable to optimize with.
We did not vary the neural architecture beyond altering the number of units in the hidden and embedding layers; for example, we did not add additional layers, try different RNN cells (e.g., LSTM), or use transformers.

\section{Computing Resources Used}
\unskip\label{hpo:sec:resources}
Experiments were performed across about $20$--$30$ NVIDIA A6000 (or equivalent) GPUs (one trial per GPU) on an institutional cluster.
We estimate approximately $5500$ GPU-hours were used for all experiments directly related to this paper, including those not documented or directly referenced.
The primary searches for the best-performing emergent languages on XferBench (Searches 1--4) took about $1300$ GPU-hours.


\section{Synthetic Languages}
\unskip\label{hpo:sec:synth}
\subsection{Definitions}
We use four probabilistic synthetic languages which span a large portion of the Chomsky hierarchy ranging from trivial to beyond context-free.
All synthetic languages contain a unique begin- and end-of-sentence token in each utterance.

\paragraph{Zipf-Mandelbrot Distribution}
The basis for our synthetic languages will be a Zipf--Mandelbrot distribution, a generalization of Zipf's law, where the unnormalized probability weight of the word $w_i$ is
\begin{equation}
  f(w_i) = \frac1{(i+\beta)^\alpha}
  ,
\end{equation}
where
  $i$ is the $1$-based index of the word,
  $\alpha$ controls the weight of the tail,
  and $\beta$ shifts where the distribution starts (roughly speaking).
Empirically, $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=2.7$ have been found to be good approximations for human language and will be the default parameters of the distribution unless otherwise specified \citep{piantadosi2014zipf}.



\paragraph{Bag of Words}
The simplest synthetic language we introduce is a bag-of-words language where each token in a sentence is sampled independently from the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution.
The length of the sentence is independent of the sampling method, so in interest of simplicity, we sample from a discrete uniform distribution.



\paragraph{Regular}
The simplest non-trivial language we introduce is a regular language which partitions the tokens uniformly at random into $k$ different sets ($s_1,\dots,s_k$), keeping their initial Zipf--Mandelbrot-derived weight.
Each sentence starts with a token sampled from $s_1$; each subsequent token is sampled from the next class ($s_i+1$) with probability $c$ or sampled from the same class ($s_i$).
After $s_k$, the sentence terminates.
Thus, the language is defined by the regular expression
\begin{equation}
  s_1^+
  s_2^+
  \dots
  s_k^+
  ,
\end{equation}
where
  $a^+=aa^*$,
  $s_i$ represents any token in the set $s_i$,
  and appropriate BoS and EoS tokens are added.


\paragraph{Dyck-$\textit{n}$}
Dyck-$n$ can be thought of as ``balanced nested delimiters'' (where the delimiters are the same token) \citep{schutzenberger1963}.
Each token in the sentence is generated as follows:
  With probability $p$, a new token is sampled from the Zipf--Mandelbrot distribution and pushed onto a stack (the ``opening delimiter''), and with probability $1-p$, the token on top of the stack is popped off.
A sentence always begins with an ``open'' token and ends when the stack is empty.
An example of such a sentence is $(3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3)$ which could be illustrated as ``\{()[()]\}''.
% \cmt{Technically this is a subset of Dyck-$n$ because we terminate after the opening delimiter is closed, so we never generate, say, ``()()''.}


\paragraph{Shuffle Dyck-$\textit{n}$}
Finally, we use Shuffle Dyck-$n$ as our last language which lies beyond context-free in the Chomsky hierarchy \citet{suzgun-etal-2019-lstm}.
Technically speaking, this language should be called Shuffle of $n$ Distinct Dyck-$1$ Languages since it is the result of randomly interleaving multiple Dyck-$1$ languages with distinct tokens.
To generate a sentence in Shuffle Dyck-$n$, we first follow the same procedure as for Dyck-$n$ but keep the individual tokens separate.
We then interleave the separate strings by appending to the sentence uniformly at random from one of the individual strings until they are empty.
% To generate a sentence in Shuffle Dyck-$n$, $n$ Dyck-$1$ languages are generated and for each token (with the same hyperparameter $p$ described above), and 
For example, if Dyck-$n$ generated ``\{([()])[]\}'', the separated strings would ``\{\}'', ``(())'', and ``[][]'', which could then be interleaved into ``\{[\}(()])''.


\subsection{Hyperparameters}

Each variation of the synthetic language maintains the default values while varying a single hyperparameter.
We vary the common hyperparameters as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[Vocabulary size]
    takes the values $10$, $100$, $1$k, $5$k, $10$k, $30$k (default: $30$k).  A vocab size of $10$ is incompatible with the Regular language and was skipped.
  \item[Zipf--Mandelbrot $\alpha$]
    takes the values $0$, $0.25$, $0.5$, $1$, $2$, and $4$ (default: $1$).
  \item[\textit{n} tokens]
    (in the whole corpus) takes the values $1$k, $10$k, $100$k, $1$M, $5$M, and $15$M (default: $15$M); this hyperparameter was not varied for the Unigram language.
\end{description}

The Unigram language has an additional hyperparameter stop probability which takes the values $0.05$, $0.1$, and $0.2$ (default: $0.1$).
The Regular language has two additional hyperparameters: repeat probability ($c$) which takes the values $0.2$, $0.4$, $0.5$, and $0.6$ (default: $0.4$), and $n$ classes which takes the values $5$, $10$, $20$, and $40$ (default: $10$).
The Dyck and Shuffle Dyck languages take the additional hyperparameter open probability with values: $0.2$, $0.3$, $0.4$, $0.5$, and $0.6$ (default: $0.5$); Shuffle Dyck is not generated with the value $0.6$ due to implementation constraints.

Previous work \citep{kharitonov2020entmin,chaabouni2021color} has analyzed entropy minimization with respect to the amount of information or, roughly speaking, task success.
We performed a brief analysis the relationship between entropy and accuracy (task success) shown in \Cref{hpo:fig:ent-vs-acc}.
While we do find significant correlation (Pearson's $r=0.57$ for Search 5r), we would not characterize it as any strict sort of entropy minimization.
That is, we observe many emergent languages which are from the Pareto frontier of high accuracy and low entropy.
Hyperparameter search demonstrates itself to be a powerful tool for investigating such correlations since it is able to generate a wide variety of emergent languages with minimal additional work from the researchers.
Nevertheless, more investigation would have to be done on this front to conclusively support or reject prior claims of entropy minimization.




\section{Hyperparameter Scatter Plots}

\Cref{hpo:fig:slice-0,hpo:fig:slice-1,hpo:fig:slice-2,hpo:fig:slice-3} show the univariate scatter plots for hyperparameter Searches 1--4.
The $y$-axis is XferBench-da score (or some smaller variation thereof, for Searches 1 and 2), and the $x$-axis is one of the hyperparameters varied for that search.
Note that other variables are \emph{not} held constant while one is varied; instead all hyperparameters are varied for each trial.
