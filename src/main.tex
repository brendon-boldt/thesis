\section{Background}

Deep learning-based emergent communication (also known as ``emergent language'') is the area of research which studies systems of communication between virtual agents that has emerged \emph{de novo} from interactions and optimizations (in the machine learning sense) in simulated environments.


\section{Motivation}

[why principled?]
